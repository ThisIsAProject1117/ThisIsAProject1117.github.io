                <p>Dear Contributors,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We welcome submissions of paranormal and true crime stories for consideration. However, it's imperative to understand the following before submitting your work:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1.  Accuracy: While we appreciate the allure of paranormal and true crime narratives, we prioritize accuracy and integrity in storytelling. Submissions should be based on verifiable facts, well-researched accounts, or credible eyewitness testimonies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.  Sensitive Content: True crime stories may contain sensitive or distressing content. We encourage contributors to approach these topics with respect and empathy for those involved. Gratuitous depictions of violence or exploitation will not be accepted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3.  Paranormal Claims: If your submission pertains to paranormal phenomena, please note that we approach such content with skepticism. While we value personal experiences, we may require additional evidence or corroborating accounts to support extraordinary claims.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4.  Legal Implications: Contributors are responsible for ensuring that their submissions comply with legal and ethical standards. Plagiarism, defamation, or infringement of intellectual property rights will result in rejection of the submission.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5.  Editorial Discretion: The editorial team reserves the right to review, edit, or reject submissions based on relevance, quality, or adherence to our editorial guidelines. Submission does not guarantee publication.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By submitting your paranormal and true crime stories, you acknowledge and agree to these terms and conditions.
